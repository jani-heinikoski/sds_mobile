This is a code repository containing everything required to pass the course Software Development Skills: Mobile 2020-21. Repository is authored only by Jani Heinikoski.
I have taken the liberty to slightly modify the course module exercises (made them a little bit more complex so I could refresh my memory for the course project).

WHERE AND WHAT

The learning diary can be found under directory ./documentation.
